        Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be
        processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing
        a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the
        services offered there.
    </p>
    <p>
        Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data
        Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"),
        "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as
        collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation,
        alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission,
        dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination,
        restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether
        by automated means or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular
        about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the
        processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction
        with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components
        we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may
        result in said third parties also processing data they collect and
        control.
    </p>
    <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
    <p>
        I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br />II. The rights
        of users and data subjects<br />III. Information about the data
        processing
    </p>
    <h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
    <p>
        The party responsible for this website (the "controller") for purposes
        of data protection law is:
    </p>
    <p>
        Everglot (ohne Handelsregistereintrag)<br />
        Berlin, Germany<br />
        E-Mail: everglotapp AT gmail.com
    </p>
    <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
    <p>
        With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below,
        users and data subjects have the right
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>
            to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed,
            information about the data being processed, further information
            about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf.
            also Art. 15 GDPR);
        </li>
        <li>
            to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art.
            16 GDPR);
        </li>
        <li>
            to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17
            DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as
            stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per
            Art. 18 GDPR;
        </li>
        <li>
            to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by
            them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers
            (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
        </li>
        <li>
            to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe
            that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in
            breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom
        it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions
        placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However,
        this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or
        involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to
        information about these recipients.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong
            >Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the
            right to object to the controller's future processing of their data
            pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection
            to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is
            permissible.</strong
        >
    </p>
    <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
    <p>
        Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as
        soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the
        deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage
        obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
    </p>
    <h4>Server data</h4>
    <p>
        For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser
        to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure
        a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and
        version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you
        came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time
        of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our
        site.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in
        association with any other of your data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our
        legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality,
        and security of our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data will be deleted within no more than seven days, unless
        continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes. In which case,
        all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion until the
        investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
    </p>
    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <h5>a) Session cookies</h5>
    <p>
        We use cookies on our website. Cookies are small text files or other
        storage technologies stored on your computer by your browser. These
        cookies process certain specific information about you, such as your
        browser, location data, or IP address. &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        This processing makes our website more user-friendly, efficient, and
        secure, allowing us, for example, to display our website in different
        languages or to offer a shopping cart function.
    </p>
    <p>
        The legal basis for such processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR,
        insofar as these cookies are used to collect data to initiate or process
        contractual relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the processing does not serve to initiate or process a contract, our
        legitimate interest lies in improving the functionality of our website.
        The legal basis is then Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>When you close your browser, these session cookies are deleted.</p>
    <h5>b) Third-party cookies</h5>
    <p>
        If necessary, our website may also use cookies from companies with whom
        we cooperate for the purpose of advertising, analyzing, or improving the
        features of our website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please refer to the following information for details, in particular for
        the legal basis and purpose of such third-party collection and
        processing of data collected through cookies.
    </p>
    <h5>c) Disabling cookies</h5>
    <p>
        You can refuse the use of cookies by changing the settings on your
        browser. Likewise, you can use the browser to delete cookies that have
        already been stored. However, the steps and measures required vary,
        depending on the browser you use. If you have any questions, please use
        the help function or consult the documentation for your browser or
        contact its maker for support. Browser settings cannot prevent so-called
        flash cookies from being set. Instead, you will need to change the
        setting of your Flash player. The steps and measures required for this
        also depend on the Flash player you are using. If you have any
        questions, please use the help function or consult the documentation for
        your Flash player or contact its maker for support.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you prevent or restrict the installation of cookies, not all of the
        functions on our site may be fully usable.
    </p>
    <h4>Customer account/registration</h4>
    <p>
        If you create a customer account with us via our website, we will use
        the data you entered during registration (e.g. your name, your address,
        or your email address) exclusively for services leading up to your
        potential placement of an order or entering some other contractual
        relationship with us, to fulfill such orders or contracts, and to
        provide customer care (e.g. to provide you with an overview of your
        previous orders or to be able to offer you a wishlist function). We also
        store your IP address and the date and time of your registration. This
        data will not be transferred to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this
        processing of your data, with reference made to this privacy policy. The
        data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide your customer
        account.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
        If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR
        is the legal basis for this processing.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the
        initiation of a contractual relationship with us or to fulfill an
        existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is also
        Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal
        data at any time under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you
        have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing
        is no longer necessary. However, we must observe any retention periods
        required under tax and commercial law.
    </p>
    <h4>Newsletter</h4>
    <p>
        If you register for our free newsletter, the data requested from you for
        this purpose, i.e. your email address and, optionally, your name and
        address, will be sent to us. We also store the IP address of your
        computer and the date and time of your registration. During the
        registration process, we will obtain your consent to receive this
        newsletter and the type of content it will offer, with reference made to
        this privacy policy. The data collected will be used exclusively to send
        the newsletter and will not be passed on to third parties.
    </p>
    <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR.</p>
    <p>
        You may revoke your prior consent to receive this newsletter under Art.
        7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that
        you are revoking your consent or click on the unsubscribe link contained
        in each newsletter.
    </p>
    <h4>Contact</h4>
    <p>
        If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide
        will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have
        this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will
        not be able to answer it in full or at all.
    </p>
    <p>
        The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and
        there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an
        order or contract resulted therefrom.
    </p>
    <h4>User posts, comments, and ratings</h4>
    <p>
        We offer you the opportunity to post questions, answers, opinions, and
        ratings on our website, hereinafter referred to jointly as "posts." If
        you make use of this opportunity, we will process and publish your post,
        the date and time you submitted it, and any pseudonym you may have used.
    </p>
    <p>
        The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke
        your prior consent under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you
        have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we will also process your IP address and email address. The
        IP address is processed because we might have a legitimate interest in
        taking or supporting further action if your post infringes the rights of
        third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our
        legitimate interest lies in any legal defense we may have to mount.
    </p>
    <div class="hidden">
        <h4>Matomo (formerly: PIWIK)</h4>
        <p>
            Our website uses Matomo (formerly: PIWIK). This is open-source
            software with which we can analyze the use of our site. Data such as
            your IP address, the pages you visit, the website from which you
            came (referrer URL), the duration of your visit, and the frequency
            of your visits is processed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Matomo stores a cookie on your device via your browser in order to
            collect this data. This cookie is valid for one week.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
            interest lies in the analysis and optimization of our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use Matomo with the "Automatically Anonymize Visitor IPs"
            function. This anonymization function truncates your IP address by
            two bytes so that it is impossible to assign it to you or to the
            internet connection you are using.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of
            preventing the installation of cookies by making the appropriate
            settings in your browser. Further details can be found in the
            section about cookies above.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, you have the option of terminating the analysis of your
            usage behavior by opting out. By confirming the link

        <p>
            a cookie is stored on your device via your browser to prevent any
            further analysis. Please note, however, that you must click the
            above link again if you delete the cookies stored on your end
            device.

    <h4>Google Fonts</h4>
    <p>
        Our website uses Google Fonts to display external fonts. This is a
        service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street,
        Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).
    </p>
    <p>
        To enable the display of certain fonts on our website, a connection to
        the Google server in the USA is established whenever our website is
        accessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest
        lies in the optimization and economic operation of our site.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you access our site, a connection to Google is established from
        which Google can identify the site from which your request has been sent
        and to which IP address the fonts are being transmitted for display.
